    /*You are given a list called listofGrades, which are generated randomly for you.
    You are also given code that prompts you for a grade between between 50 and 70 that is then assigned to a variable called dropThreshold.
    Note that you will need to remove the comment symbols to get the code that prompts you for dropThreshold to work.
    Write a function named dropGradesBelow that takes two inputs (a list and a number) and then performs the following actions inside the function:
    1. Calculate and print out the average of the grades in the list.
    2. Determine whether each grade in list is greater than the threshold grade that you assigned.
    3. Create a new list of only those grades that are greater than the threshold grade that you assigned.
    4. Calculate and print out the new average after the appropriate grades have been dropped.
    5. Return a new list containing only those grades that have not been dropped.

    Call the function dropGradesBelow and print out the list returned by dropGradesBelow.*/
