The phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” is, at this time, 
credited to a 19th century traveling soap salesman by the name of Elbert Hubbard. 
He achieved limited notoriety for works such as Jesus Was An Anarchist (1910) 
and Health and Wealth (1908), passionately proclaiming his opinions on religion, 
subaltern politics, and personal hygiene. W says that the latter text is full 
of “truisms”, which are statements that are obvious to the point of them 
needing not be said. (You may already know what that word means — I 
clarify the definition only because I didn’t know it.) Yet, despite 
costs of living obviously sharply declining as we travel backwards 
through time (as opposed to the normal way), if a man was able to 
make a full living as a traveling soap salesman back then, maybe 
his essay of notes on personal health wasn’t too superfluous.
In 1908, Hubbard was invited to deliver a keynote speech at a 
meeting of The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves.
